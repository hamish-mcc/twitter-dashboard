# twitter-dashboard
A tool for exploring interconnections between topics/hashtags on twitter. Insight can be drawn from visual analysis of a network graph, as well as sentiment analysis.

'app.py' is a Plotly Dash app. Run this file then access the dashboard in your browser.

You will need to generate your own keys for the Twitter API and enter these in 'credentials.json'
